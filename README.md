# elasticsearch-paris-accidentology-demo
===================================
## Introduction ##

This Docker Compose project is an application which intends to demonstrate
ELK capabilities through Paris city accidentology use case

## Architecture

This application is a ES based logging architecture that combines: 
- A logtsash-forwarder that consumes the source/accidentology-with-geo-final.csv file
- A logstash instance that processes the message before pushing to a Kafka cluster
- A Kafka cluster (composed of 2 instances) that receives message and buffer them
- A logstash instance that indexes the message in Elasticsearch
- A single Elasticsearch node cluster
- A Kibana 4 instance to visualize the data

This application also showcases Elasticsearch commercial plugin:
- Marvel is installed and let you follow the activity of the ES cluster
- Shield is included and secure the overall ES cluster: you need 
to refer to the below [LDAP](https://github.com/bahaaldine/elasticsearch-paris-accidentology-demo/blob/master/README.md#ldap-users-and-groups) section to understand which user should be used in order
to interact with the cluster.
- Watcher is installed but no watch are included.
